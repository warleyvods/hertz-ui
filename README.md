- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `storybook`: [React.js](https://react.dev/) app with storybbok initialised, it can be used as a react app but more specifically wanted it to test components independently using storybook
- `@hertz/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications which includes [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [MUI - material ui](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) and [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) as the bundler

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for ui design and components
- [MUI - material ui](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) for ui design and components
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for pre-commit hook

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```shell
cd template
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```shell
npx turbo link
```
